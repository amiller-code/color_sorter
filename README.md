# Color Sorter

This is a Python tool used to detect and sort colors in an uploaded image.

## Usage

To use this tool, download the main.py file and run with a Python IDE or Command Line.

Once it has run, a GUI will appear. Click the Browse button and select a PNG or JPEG file from your drive.

After the image appears on the GUI, use the sliders to select the number of colors you would like to detect and the delta between the colors (lower delta will result in smaller distinctions between colors).

Click Run and the table will populate with the corresponding colors from the image. The user can then select a different image or different settings and run again.
